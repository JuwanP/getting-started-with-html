    <b>The Basics of the Web</b>
    <p>The web is made up of a collection of HTML documents. <em>HTML</em> stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>. Here is a link to the w3schools page on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a> </p>
    <!--A link above that takes you to w3school's page on HTML-->
    <p>When we go on our computers to browsers like, Chrome, FireFox, or Internet Explorer, and go to websites like www.google.com we send data to the <em>Cloud</em> which sends an <em>HTTP requests</em> to <em>servers</em>. The servers finds the appropriate files and sends the needed files back to our web browsers. The web browser then interprets and displays the files on our computers for the user to see. </p>
    
    <b>The Main Document on the Web</b>
    <p><em>HTML</em> is the main type of document on the web. However, it's not the only type file, tht can exist on th web. Other files include: <em>PDFs, Images, videos etc.</em></p>

    <b>HTML</b>
    <p>An HTML is made up of text Content: <em>what you see</em>, Markup: <em>what it looks like</em>, and References to other documents: <em>e.g. images and videos as well as links to other pages</em></p>
      
    <b>Inline vs. Blocks</b>
    <p><b>Inline elements</b> such as: <em>bold, emphasis, image, span</em> are displayed with no line breaks. On the other hand, <b>block elements</b> such as: <em>div and paragraph</em> are displayed with an "invisible box" that separates them from surrounding elements, ands displays each one block element on a separate line.
